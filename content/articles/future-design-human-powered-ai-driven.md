For years, reports have been warning of technology taking away jobs, particularly in fields like food preparation, truck driving, and warehouse operations. These jobs are often considered “blue-collar” and involve repetitive manual labor. However, many in the creative community believed their careers were immune to automation. After all, a designer’s craft is anything but monotonous. While computers can crunch numbers quickly, how are they going to be able to design?

### Basic link
[Add Your Link](http://https://gohugo.io)

### Wrap inline snippets of code with <code>`</code>.

```markdown
In this example, `<section></section>` should be wrapped as **code**.
```

The rendered output looks like this:

In this example, `<section></section>` should be wrapped as **code**.

The HTML looks like this:

```html

  In this example, <code>&lt;section&gt;&lt;/section&gt;</code> should be wrapped with <strong>code</strong>.
</p>
```

### Blockquotes **[#](#blockquotes)**
For quoting blocks of content from another source within your document.

Add **>** before any text you want to quote.

### Lists **[#](#lists)**
+ Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
+ Consectetur adipiscing elit
+ Integer molestie lorem at massa
+ Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
+ Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
  - Phasellus iaculis neque
  - Purus sodales ultricies

  - Ac tristique libero volutpat at
+ Faucibus porta lacus fringilla vel
+ Aenean sit amet erat nunc

### Tables **[#](#tables)**

Tables are created by adding pipes as dividers between each cell, and by adding a line of dashes (also separated by bars) beneath the header. Note that the pipes do not need to be vertically aligned.

| ------:| -----------:|
| data   | path to data files to supply the data that will be passed into templates. |
